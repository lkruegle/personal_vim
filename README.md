If you can see this, you can use it, I don't care. (I'm going to, thanks)

My personal vim configuration, largely stored here so I can keep it synchronized across machines.

Most things taken from https://github.com/amix/vimrc, but trimmed down to only include things I understand and use routinely.

Note: per [this fantastically useful SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10784189), the fugitive submodule contained herein needs to be properly set up after copying the folders (such as, when I clone my repo to a fresh machine):
```
cd .vim/bundles/vim-fugitive
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
